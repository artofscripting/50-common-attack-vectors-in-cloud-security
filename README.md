#### Here are 50 common attack vectors in cloud security:

1.     **Misconfiguration:** This is one of the most common cloud security risks. It occurs
when cloud resources are not set up securely, leaving them vulnerable to
attack. This can include things like leaving public storage buckets open to the
internet or using weak passwords.

2.     **Insecure APIs:** APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) are essential for
cloud applications, but they can also be a security risk if not properly
secured. Attackers can exploit vulnerabilities in APIs to gain access to
sensitive data or take control of cloud resources.

3.     **Malware Injection:** Attackers can inject malware into cloud environments through
various methods, such as phishing emails or compromised websites. Once malware
is on a cloud system, it can steal data, disrupt operations, or launch further
attacks.

4.     **Denial-of-Service (DoS) Attacks:** These attacks aim to
overwhelm a cloud service with traffic, making it unavailable to legitimate
users. DoS attacks can be disruptive and costly for businesses.

5.     **Account Hijacking:** Attackers can steal cloud account credentials through phishing
attacks, social engineering, or malware. Once they have access to an account,
they can use it to steal data, deploy malware, or launch other attacks.

6.     **Insider Threats:** Unfortunately, even trusted users can be a security risk.
Insiders may accidentally or intentionally misuse their access to cloud
resources.

7.     **Insufficient Encryption:** Data encryption is essential for protecting
sensitive information in the cloud. If data is not encrypted, it can be stolen
by attackers who gain access to cloud storage.

8.     **Zero-Day Attacks:** These are attacks that exploit vulnerabilities in software that
the software vendor is not even aware of yet. Zero-day attacks can be very
difficult to defend against.

9.     **Weak Password Management:** Weak or reused passwords are a major
security risk. Attackers can use brute-force attacks or password spraying
techniques to guess passwords and gain access to cloud accounts.

10. **Supply Chain Attacks:** These attacks target
    third-party vendors that supply software or services to cloud providers. If a
    vendor is compromised, attackers can gain access to the cloud environments of
    the vendor's customers.

11. **Insecure Containerization:** Containers are a popular
    way to package and deploy applications in the cloud. However, if container
    security is not properly managed, vulnerabilities in containers can be
    exploited to attack the underlying host system or other containers.

12. **Unrestricted API Access:** APIs should have granular
    access controls in place. Overly permissive access rules can grant attackers
    more privileges than intended, allowing them to manipulate data or take control
    of resources.

13. **Cloud Storage Hijacking:** Attackers might target
    misconfigured cloud storage buckets or exploit weak access controls to steal
    sensitive data stored in the cloud. This can include intellectual property,
    financial records, or personal information.

14. **Hidden Costs:** Cloud pricing models can
    be complex, and unexpected charges can arise due to misconfiguration or
    malicious activity. For instance, cryptojacking utilizes cloud resources for
    cryptocurrency mining without authorization, leading to increased costs.

15. **Lack of Visibility:** Traditional security
    tools might not be optimized for cloud environments. Limited visibility into
    cloud activity makes it difficult to detect and respond to threats promptly.

16. **Eavesdropping:** Unencrypted communication
    channels between cloud components or between the user and the cloud can be
    intercepted by attackers. This allows them to steal sensitive information or
    inject malicious data.

17. **Man-in-the-Cloud Attacks:** These attacks involve
    compromising a legitimate cloud service provider or administrator account. Once
    attackers have control, they can manipulate user data, deploy malware, or
    launch further attacks on the provider's customers.

18. **Lateral Movement:** After gaining access to
    an initial foothold in the cloud environment, attackers might use techniques to
    move laterally across the system. This allows them to compromise additional
    resources and expand their reach within the cloud.

19. **Compliance Failures:** Cloud environments need
    to adhere to specific industry regulations or internal security policies.
    Failure to comply can lead to data breaches, fines, and reputational damage.

20. **Physical Security Risks:** While cloud providers
    handle most physical security, some aspects might be overlooked. Data loss or
    compromise can occur due to physical breaches in data centers or inadequate
    access controls for personnel.

21. **Steganography:** Attackers can hide
    malicious code or data within seemingly harmless files like images or audio.
    Traditional security scanners might miss such attacks as they focus on file
    type and not content.

22. **Abusive Use of Cloud
    Services:** Cloud services offer various functionalities, but some can be
    misused for malicious purposes. For instance, attackers might abuse cloud
    functions or serverless computing for launching denial-of-service attacks or
    deploying spam campaigns.

23. **Compromised Public Cloud
    Images:** Public cloud marketplaces offer pre-configured virtual machine images for
    faster deployment. However, these images might be tampered with by attackers to
    include vulnerabilities or malware.

24. **Insecure Serverless
    Functions:** Serverless functions are event-driven and provide a convenient
    way to build cloud applications. However, insecure coding practices or
    misconfigurations in serverless functions can expose vulnerabilities for
    attackers to exploit.

25. **API Keys and Secrets
    Management:** Cloud APIs often rely on access keys and secrets for
    authentication. Poor management of these credentials, such as storing them in
    plain text or weak password practices, can lead to unauthorized access.

26. **Supply Chain Dependencies:** Cloud-based applications
    often rely on various third-party libraries and frameworks. Vulnerabilities in
    these dependencies can be exploited by attackers to gain access to the main
    application or the cloud environment.

27. **Social Engineering
    Attacks:** Social engineering tactics like phishing emails or phone calls can target cloud
    users to trick them into revealing sensitive information or granting access to
    cloud resources.

28. **Business Logic Flaws:** Cloud applications might
    have vulnerabilities in their business logic, allowing attackers to manipulate
    data or bypass security controls even with proper authentication.

29. **Lack of Incident Response
    Plan:** Even with strong security measures, breaches can still occur. Having a
    well-defined incident response plan ensures a quick and coordinated response to
    minimize damage and recover from an attack.

30. **Data Exfiltration Through
    APIs:** Attackers can exploit vulnerabilities in APIs to exfiltrate sensitive data from
    the cloud environment. This can involve unauthorized data transfer or
    manipulation of API calls to steal information.

31. **Insecure Server-Side
    Request Forgery (SSRF):** SSRF vulnerabilities can allow attackers to trick a cloud
    server into making unauthorized requests to external systems. This could be
    used to steal data, launch denial-of-service attacks, or gain access to
    internal resources.

32. **Insecure Deserialization:** Deserialization is the
    process of converting serialized data back into its original format.
    Vulnerabilities in deserialization libraries can allow attackers to inject
    malicious code into the cloud environment when processing data.

33. **Cloud Jacking:** This attack involves
    taking over a cloud account, often through stolen credentials or brute-force
    attacks. Once attackers have control, they can use the account's resources for
    malicious purposes or launch further attacks on other systems.

34. **Homograph Attacks:** These attacks exploit
    visual similarities between characters to deceive users. Attackers might
    register domain names with look-alike characters resembling the legitimate
    cloud service provider to trick users into entering credentials on a fake login
    page.

35. **Cloud Malware:** Traditional malware isn't
    the only threat. Cloud-specific malware can target vulnerabilities in cloud
    platforms or applications to steal data, disrupt operations, or spread
    laterally within the cloud environment.

36. **Misuse of Cloud Billing
    Accounts:** Malicious actors might gain access to cloud billing accounts
    and incur unauthorized charges for compute resources or services used for
    illegal activities like cryptojacking.

37. **Shadow IT:** Unauthorized use of cloud
    services outside the organization's IT department creates security risks.
    Shadow IT resources may lack proper security controls and increase the attack
    surface for malicious actors.

38. **Lack of User Training:** Even with strong
    technical security measures, user awareness is crucial. Employees who lack
    proper training on cloud security best practices might fall victim to social
    engineering attacks or accidentally misconfigure resources.

39. **Outdated Software:** Running outdated software
    on cloud instances exposes vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit.
    Maintaining up-to-date software with the latest security patches is essential
    for cloud security.

40. **Data Residency Issues:** Cloud providers have data
    centers in various locations. Understanding data residency regulations and
    ensuring data is stored in compliance with relevant laws is critical to avoid
    legal ramifications and potential data breaches.

41. **Insecure In-Memory Data
    Storage:** Sensitive data processed within cloud applications might be temporarily stored
    in memory. Inadequate memory protection mechanisms can leave this data
    vulnerable to scraping or exploitation by attackers who gain access to the
    cloud environment.

42. **Insecure Cloud
    Orchestration Platforms:** Cloud orchestration platforms manage and automate the
    deployment of cloud resources. Vulnerabilities in these platforms can give
    attackers a foothold to manipulate configurations, deploy malware across cloud
    instances, or disrupt critical cloud operations.

43. **Time-of-Check/Time-of-Use
    (TOCTTOU) Attacks:** These attacks exploit the time gap between when a user's access
    is verified and when the actual action is performed. An attacker might gain
    temporary access and exploit this window to perform unauthorized actions before
    the system detects the compromised credentials.

44. **Denial-of-Service (DoS)
    Attacks on the Management Plane:** Attackers can target the cloud provider's management plane,
    which controls and configures cloud resources. A successful DoS attack on the
    management plane can disrupt cloud operations and prevent users from accessing
    their resources.

45. **Unpatched Cloud Provider
    Vulnerabilities:** Even cloud providers are not immune to vulnerabilities.
    Zero-day attacks targeting cloud provider software or infrastructure can be
    particularly dangerous as organizations might not have time to patch before
    attackers exploit them.

46. **Insider Threats with
    Privileged Access:** While most insider threats involve basic user accounts,
    attackers might target privileged accounts with extensive permissions.
    Compromised privileged credentials can grant attackers nearly unrestricted
    access to manipulate data, deploy malware, or disrupt cloud services.

47. **API Rate Limiting Bypass:** APIs often have rate
    limits to prevent abuse. Attackers might develop techniques to bypass these
    limits and overwhelm the API with requests, causing a denial-of-service attack
    or potentially extracting sensitive information through brute-force attempts.

48. **Insecure Container
    Orchestration Platforms:** Similar to cloud orchestration platforms, vulnerabilities in
    container orchestration platforms used to manage containerized applications can
    be exploited by attackers to gain control of containers, steal data, or disrupt
    deployments.

49. **Lack of Data Loss
    Prevention (DLP):** Data loss prevention solutions help organizations identify and
    prevent sensitive data from being exfiltrated from the cloud environment. The
    absence of DLP solutions increases the risk of data breaches and unauthorized
    data transfers.

50. **Evolving Regulatory
    Landscape:** Cloud security regulations are constantly evolving. Failing to
    keep up with these changes can leave organizations vulnerable to legal
    repercussions or compliance issues that might expose sensitive data or limit
    cloud service functionality.
